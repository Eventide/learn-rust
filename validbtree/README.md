# Determine if a Binary Search Tree is valid.

## Problem

Determine if a binary search tree
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) of distinct integers is valid.
A binary search tree is valid if every node is strictly greater than every node
in it's left subtree and strictly less than every node in it's right subtree.

For example:

      5
     / \
    3   7
   / \
  1   6

is invalid the left subtree contains the value 6, which is greater than the
value of the root node (5).
