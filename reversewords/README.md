# Reverse the Words in a String

## Problem

Reverse the words in a string in-place using only O(1) memory. The
string contains only ASCII characters and all characters other than
the space character (ASCII 0x20) are considered word characters.

For example:

    "Hello World from Rust!" => "Rust! from World Hello"
