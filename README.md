# Learning Rust through Interview Questions

This reposity is the product of my first in earnest attempt to
learn [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/).

I didn't have a particular probem to tackle so I used job interview
coding questions that I found on the internet. In particular,
["Hacking a Google Interview"](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/iap/interview/materials.php)
contains a lot of interesting questions.

Since this was a learning project, some of the code might not be
idiomatic (or even sane). Corrections are welcome and can be
sent in the form of pull requests or an email to brian@sweetapp.com.

## Understandability

Assuming that you know another programming language, here is how I
would order each problem in order of increasing difficultly.

* [printmult](https://github.com/brianquinlan/learn-rust/tree/master/printmult) -
  Print the 12x12 multiplication table.
* [fizzbuzz](https://github.com/brianquinlan/learn-rust/tree/master/fizzbuzz) -
  Count to 100 using the words "Fizz", "Buzz" and "FizzBuzz".
* [oddman](https://github.com/brianquinlan/learn-rust/blob/master/oddman) -
  Find the missing integer in a list.
* [substring](https://github.com/brianquinlan/learn-rust/tree/master/substring) -
  Determine if a string is a substring of another.
* [sumfile](https://github.com/brianquinlan/learn-rust/tree/master/sumfile) -
  Sum the contents of a text file.
* [targetsum](https://github.com/brianquinlan/learn-rust/tree/master/targetsum) -
  Find pairs in a list that sum to a value.
* [validbtree](https://github.com/brianquinlan/learn-rust/tree/master/validbtree) -
  Determine if a binary tree is valid.
* [reversewords](https://github.com/brianquinlan/learn-rust/tree/master/reversewords) -
  Reverse the words in a string.
* [minstack](https://github.com/brianquinlan/learn-rust/tree/master/minstack) -
  Implement a stack with O(1) getMinimumValue.
* [bestpath](https://github.com/brianquinlan/learn-rust/tree/master/bestpath) -
  Return the fastest path through a maze.
* [i18n](https://github.com/brianquinlan/learn-rust/tree/master/i18n) -
  Expand patterns like "i18n".
