# Determine if a String is a Substring of Another String

## Problem

Determine if a string is a substring of another string. The implementation does
not have to be efficient in terms of time or space.

For example:

    string: "Batman"   sub: "at"     => true
    string: "Dog"      sub: "food"   => false
