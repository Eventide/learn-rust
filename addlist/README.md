# Increment a Number Presented as a Linked-List

## Problem

Increment a number represented as a linked list. Each node contains a single digit
and the most significant digit is stored in the head of the list.

For example:

    [ 1 ] --> [ 2 ] --> [ 3 ]   =>   [ 1 ] --> [ 2 ] --> [ 4 ]
    [ 1 ] --> [ 9 ] --> [ 9 ]   =>   [ 2 ] --> [ 0 ] --> [ 0 ]
